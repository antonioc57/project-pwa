  <h1>Hacking</h1>
  <h3>
    UA security hacker is someone who explores methods for breaching
    defenses and exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network.
  </h3>
  <h3>
    Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons, such as profit,
    protest, information gathering, challenge, recreation, or to evaluate
    system weaknesses to assist in formulating defenses against potential
    hackers. The subculture that has evolved around hackers is often
    referred to as the "computer underground".
